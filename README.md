# AI Log Anomaly Detection System

![AI Log Anomaly Detection Output](anomaly-output.png)

An intelligent monitoring system that uses Machine Learning to automatically detect abnormal patterns in system logs.

This project demonstrates how AI can be applied to real-world cloud infrastructure monitoring to identify rare and unexpected behavior without labeled training data.

## 🚀 Features

- Reads structured log data (CSV format)
- Applies Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection
- Identifies abnormal system behavior automatically
- Visualizes normal vs anomaly events
- Clean Python implementation

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used:
Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)

Why Isolation Forest?
It is efficient for detecting rare and abnormal patterns in high-dimensional datasets without requiring labeled training data.

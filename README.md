# AI Log Anomaly Detector

This project uses Machine Learning to automatically detect abnormal behavior in system logs such as CPU spikes, unusual request patterns, and high error counts.

It simulates how modern cloud monitoring systems use AI to identify anomalies in production environments.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Reads structured log data (CSV format)
- Applies Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection
- Identifies abnormal system behavior automatically
- Visualizes normal vs anomaly events
- Clean Python implementation

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used:
Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)

Why Isolation Forest?
It is efficient for detecting rare and abnormal patterns in high-dimensional datasets without requiring labeled training data.
